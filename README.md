# SudokuSolver - ML-Free, Excercise in Numpy's Broadcasting and Vectorization Application
ML-Free Implementation of Sudoku Solver in Numpy

Recently, there is fashion to use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learninig (DL) to solve all tasks presented to ML researcher. While exploring the topic, I came to one task that seems to be well suited for non-ML implementation: Solving Sudoku.

This implementation is instead an example of Numpy's power to Broadcast and Vectorize array calculations.

It Solves many Initial Boards considered the hardest to solve (In Windows Sudoku Implementation and Dedicated Game Books). But it fails to solve the Intial Board considered to be the 3rd most diffcult to solve in the world one.

It is offers Level 1 search only (concept discussed within the .py file), which is possibly the reason why it cannot solve the hardest task. we wil implement multi-level implementation soon

# HOW TO USE:

1.) put your intial values in:
start_values = () # use Excel Helper file to prepare imput.

2.) Run the file
