# SudokuSolver - ML-Free, Excercise in Numpy's Broadcasting and Vectorization Application
ML-Free Implementation of Sudoku Solver

Recently, there is fashion to use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learninig (DL) to solve all tasks presented to ML researcher. While exploring the topic, I came to one task that seems better suited to non-ML implementation: Solving Sudoku.

This implementation is instead an example of Numpy's power to Broadcast and Vectorize array calculations.

This is an incomplete implementation, but works fine with the example in the file (taken from Windows Sudoku Implementation). It will fail with more diffciult to solve initial set of values.

Finalized version comming soon...

# HOW TO USE:

1.) put your intial values in:
start_values = ()

2.) Run the file
