# SudokuSolver - ML-Free, Excercise in Numpy's Broadcasting and Vectorization Application
ML-Free Implementation of Sudoku Solver in Numpy

Recently, there is trend to use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learninig (DL) to solve all tasks thrown at researcher. While exploring the topic, I came to one task that seems to be well suited for non-ML implementation: Solving Sudoku.

This implementation is thus an example of Numpy's power to Broadcast and Vectorize array calculations.

It Solves many Initial Boards considered the hardest to solve (In Windows Sudoku Implementation and Dedicated Game Books). But it fails to solve the Intial Board considered to be the 3rd most diffcult to solve in the world.

It implements Level 1 search only (concept discussed within the .py file), which is possibly the reason why it cannot solve the hardest task. We wil implement multi-level implementation soon

In case you find yourself in situation where Sudoku presented to you is "Not Solvable", try it with this tool! Please send us the Initial Board if you find that the tool cannot solve it either!

# HOW TO USE:

1.) put your intial values in:
start_values = () # use Excel Helper file to prepare imput.

2.) Run the file
